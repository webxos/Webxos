        <!-- Section 5: Against the Grain -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Against the Grain of Large LLMs</h2>
            <p>Large LLMs, while powerful, pose significant challenges: they consume vast amounts of energy (up to 500 kWh for training a single model), rely on centralized data centers, and often compromise user privacy through cloud storage. WebXOS takes a radically different approach, prioritizing sustainability, efficiency, and user empowerment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>: Our tools use 50-70% less compute power, with tasks averaging 0.1 kWh compared to 1-5 kWh for LLMs. This reduces carbon emissions and supports global climate goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Client-Side Processing</strong>: By running AI and games in-browser, we eliminate server-side energy costs and reduce latency by up to 80%, ensuring seamless performance on low-power devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: Client-side encryption via tools like GridLocker and Scrambler ensures data never leaves the user’s device, unlike LLMs that store data in vulnerable clouds.</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralized Philosophy</strong>: Our front-end architecture aligns with Web3 principles, fostering a decentralized ecosystem that empowers users rather than corporations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While we integrate with LLMs via <span class="highlight">ARCR</span> for specific tasks, our focus remains on standalone, optimized solutions that deliver maximum impact with minimal resources.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 6: Comparative Analysis -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>WebXOS vs. Other AI</h2>
            <p>WebXOS sets a new benchmark in regenerative AI, outperforming both large LLMs and other sustainable AI platforms. The following charts illustrate our advantages:</p>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="energyChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>: WebXOS consumes ~0.1 kWh per task, compared to 3 kWh for large LLMs and 0.5 kWh for competing regenerative AI platforms. This efficiency stems from our client-side architecture, which minimizes computational overhead and eliminates server energy costs.</p>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="latencyChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Latency</strong>: WebXOS achieves 20-50 ms latency for AI and gaming tasks, versus 100-300 ms for cloud-based AI. Our browser-based processing ensures near-instantaneous performance, critical for real-time applications on mobile devices.</p>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="privacyChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: WebXOS scores 95/100 on privacy metrics, surpassing industry averages (70/100 for LLMs, 80/100 for others). Our client-side encryption and local data processing eliminate risks associated with cloud storage, empowering users with full control.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 7: Data Privacy -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Uncompromising Data Privacy</h2>
            <p>At WebXOS, user data sovereignty is non-negotiable. Our tools, including <span class="highlight">GridLocker</span>, <span class="highlight">Scrambler</span>, and <span class="highlight">CodeSign</span>, employ advanced client-side encryption using quantum-resistant algorithms like AES-256 and lattice-based cryptography. By processing data locally, we eliminate the need for cloud storage, reducing both security risks and energy consumption associated with data transfers.</p>
            <p>Unlike large LLMs, which often store user inputs in centralized servers, WebXOS ensures that sensitive data—whether game progress, AI prompts, or encrypted messages—remains on the user’s device. This approach not only protects privacy but also aligns with our regenerative mission by minimizing the environmental impact of data processing. Our tools are audited regularly to maintain the highest standards of security and transparency.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 8: Future Plans -->
