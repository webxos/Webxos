        <h1>Launch Sequence - Info</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Launch Sequence is an advanced control application designed for managing four IoT-enabled drones and rockets. Featuring a vibrant neon green interface inspired by WebXOS branding, it offers a futuristic platform for real-time mission control. The app supports both simulation and live modes, incorporating quantum-linked controls for seamless synchronization across agents. Advanced popup modules allow users to connect agents to external APIs, enabling integration with cloud-based systems for enhanced functionality. Optimized for edge computing, it ensures lightweight performance on mobile devices, making it ideal for aerospace operations. Developed with a minimalist design, it balances functionality with a sleek, cyberpunk aesthetic, drawing inspiration from SpaceX mission control systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Launch Sequence provides a streamlined interface to manage four agents, each controlling a rocket or drone. Key features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agent Management</strong>: Assign tasks such as Launch, Orbit, or None to individual agents, with real-time status updates displayed on the interface. Each agent’s location and task are monitored continuously.</li>
                <li><strong>Simulator Mode</strong>: Practice controlling devices with mock telemetry, mimicking real-world behavior without requiring an API connection. This mode is ideal for training purposes and testing mission scenarios.</li>
                <li><strong>Live Mode</strong>: Connect to IoT devices via popup API modules, where users input endpoint, key, and seeding parameters to enable real-time telemetry and control. This mode requires validated API credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum-Linked Controls</strong>: Toggle quantum linking to synchronize tasks and statuses across all four agents, ensuring seamless coordination for complex missions. This feature simulates quantum networking for instant task propagation.</li>
                <li><strong>Launch Sequence</strong>: Initiate a pre-programmed sequence (Pre-Launch, Ignition, Ascent) for coordinated mission execution, reflecting aerospace launch protocols used by organizations like SpaceX.</li>
                <li><strong>3D Visualization</strong>: A dynamic globe displays agent locations (latitude, longitude) in real-time, enhanced with Three.js for a futuristic 3D effect, providing a visual representation of mission progress.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users can switch between Simulator and Live modes, with API connectivity validated through the popup interface, ensuring flexibility and operational readiness. The app’s design minimizes clutter, focusing on essential controls for efficient use in high-stakes environments.</p>
