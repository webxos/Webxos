        <h1>Quantum Relay BETA: The Future of Gaming in webX 2025</h1>

        <h2>Racing in the Quantum Era</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the future of gaming with <strong>Quantum Relay Race</strong>, a game that leverages the cutting-edge technology of <strong>webX 2025</strong>. In this world, traditional rules of physics give way to the unpredictability of quantum mechanics. Here's how the game operates:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quantum Simulation</strong>: Each race simulates quantum states where outcomes are not predetermined but emerge from probability functions. Agents, or racers, navigate these quantum probabilities, making each race unique.</li>
            <li><strong>Agents and Medals</strong>: Four agents compete in each race, with the fastest receiving gold, followed by silver and bronze. The last place agent is replaced by a new one in the next race, mimicking quantum entanglement where information or state can be transferred.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Environment</strong>: Race locations and agent names are randomly generated, reflecting the fluid, ever-changing nature of quantum systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>webX 2025 Integration</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>webX 2025</strong> is not just an operating system; it's an ecosystem where quantum computing principles are seamlessly integrated into daily life, including gaming. Here's how it enhances your gaming experience:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real Quantum Effects</strong>: The game uses simulated quantum mechanics for race outcomes, providing an authentic taste of quantum computing's potential.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Graphics and UI</strong>: With webX 2025, the game's visuals adapt to user preference and quantum states, ensuring every player experiences a personalized, dynamic environment.</li>
            <li><strong>AI and Machine Learning</strong>: The OS employs advanced AI to learn from player behavior, optimizing game difficulty and narrative.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>NFT and Quantum Record Keeping</h2>
        <p>
            Still in testing phase, trail only, <strong>NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)</strong> are more than digital collectibles; they represent unique achievements or moments in quantum gaming:
