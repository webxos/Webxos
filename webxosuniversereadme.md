🎮 How to Play

Launch the Game:

Run the Python script to start the game.
Enter your AI's name to begin your journey as a rogue mining ship.


Available Commands:

launch: Launch your ship into space (costs 50 resources).
land: Land on a planet to mine resources (10% chance of collision).
mine: Extract resources from the current planet, with a mini-game to continue or stop mining.


Game Mechanics:

Resources: Used for launching and affected by random events. Depleting resources ends the game.
